FlameNET is a very lightweight, quick little browser.

Features, albeit weak;

- Address bar. :O
- Works with Frash by comex.
- All-4 rotation support.
- is.gd URL shortening via address bar.
- AirPrint support! (untested, as of 1.3)

Settings menu and download window coming soon. (Download window button/window is setup etc. Just need to fill that in :) )

You can find latest, stable, released versions on the ModMyi repo.
